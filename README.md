# Binary Negative Numbers
## Created by Erin Shawhan
This is a tutorial for on representing **negative numbers** in binary intended for beginners wanting to learn more about digital information. The **binary number system** is a base-2 number system, meaning that it only uses two symbols, 0 and 1. In the number system we use everyday, the base-10 **decimal system** (symbols 0-9), we can represent negative numbers by putting a negative sign in front of the number. However, in binary, we can only use 0s and 1s to represent negative numbers. In this tutorial, I will cover **3 ways** to represent negative numbers in binary: *sign magnitude*, *1's complement*, and *2's complement*.
